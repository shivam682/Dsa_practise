Problem Statement: Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, 
check whether it contains any cycle or not. 
*/

/*
Approach:
Initial configuration:
    Queue: Define a queue and insert the source node along with parent data (<source node, parent>). For example, (2, 1) means 2 is the source node and 1 is its parent node.
    Visited array: an array initialized to 0 indicating unvisited nodes.  

The algorithm steps are as follows:

1. For BFS traversal, we need a queue data structure and a visited array. 
2. Push the pair of the source node and its parent data (<source, parent>) in the queue, and mark the node as visited. The parent will be needed so that we donâ€™t do a backward traversal in the graph, we just move frontwards. 
3. Start the BFS traversal, pop out an element from the queue every time and travel to all its unvisited neighbors using an adjacency list.
4. Repeat the steps either until the queue becomes empty, or a node appears to be already visited which is not the parent, even though we traveled in different directions during the traversal, indicating there is a cycle.
5. If the queue becomes empty and no such node is found then there is no cycle in the graph.
6. A graph can have connected components as well. In such cases, if any component forms a cycle then the graph is said to have a cycle. We can follow the algorithm for the same:

/*
Output:  0

Time Complexity: O(N + 2E) + O(N), Where N = Nodes, 2E is for total degrees as we traverse all adjacent nodes. In the case of connected components of a graph, it will take another O(N) time.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N) ~ O(N), Space for queue data structure and visited array.

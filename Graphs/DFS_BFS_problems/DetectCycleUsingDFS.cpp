/*
Problem Statement: Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, 
check whether it contains any cycle or not. 
*/

/*
Approach:
The algorithm steps are as follows:

1. In the DFS function call make sure to store the parent data along with the source node, create a visited array, and initialize to 0. The parent is stored so that while checking for re-visited nodes, we donâ€™t check for parents. 
2. We run through all the unvisited adjacent nodes using an adjacency list and call the recursive dfs function. Also, mark the node as visited.
3. If we come across a node that is already marked as visited and is not a parent node, then keep on returning true indicating the presence of a cycle; otherwise return false after all the adjacent nodes have been checked and we did not find a cycle.
NOTE: We can call it a cycle only if the already visited node is a non-parent node because we cannot say we came to a node that was previously the parent node. 

For example, node 2 has two adjacent nodes 1 and 5. 1 is already visited but it is the parent node ( DFS(2, 1) ), So this cannot be called a cycle.

/*
Output:  0

Time Complexity: O(N + 2E) + O(N), Where N = Nodes, 2E is for total degrees as we traverse all adjacent nodes. In the case of connected components of a graph, it will take another O(N) time.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N) ~ O(N), Space for queue data structure and visited array.

/*
Problem Statement: Given a weighted, directed and connected graph of V vertices and E edges, Find the shortest distance of all the vertices from the source vertex S.

Note: If the Graph contains a negative cycle then return an array consisting of only -1.
*/

/*
Approach:

Initial Configuration:

distance array(dist[ ]): The dist[] array will be initialized with infinity, except for the source node as dist[src] will be initialized to 0.

The algorithm steps will be the following:

1. First, we will initialize the source node in the distance array to 0 and the rest of the nodes to infinity.
2. Then we will run a loop for N-1 times.
3. Inside that loop, we will try to relax every given edge.
4. For example, one of the given edge information is like (u, v, wt), where u = starting node of the edge, v = ending node, and wt = edge weight. For all edges like this we will be checking if node u is reachable and if the distance to reach v through u is less than the distance to v found until now(i.e. dist[u] and dist[u]+ wt < dist[v]).
5. After repeating the 3rd step for N-1 times, we will apply the same step one more time to check if the negative cycle exists. If we found further relaxation is possible, we will conclude the graph has a negative cycle and from this step, we will return a distance array of -1(i.e. minimization of distances is not possible).
6. Otherwise, we will return the distance array which contains all the minimized distances.

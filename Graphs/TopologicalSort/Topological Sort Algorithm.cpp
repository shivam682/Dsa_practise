/*
Problem Statement: 
Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices
 and E edges, Find any Topological Sorting of that Graph.
*/

/*
Approach: 

We will be solving it using the DFS traversal technique. DFS goes in-depth, i.e., traverses all nodes by going ahead, and when there are no further nodes to traverse in the current path, then it backtracks on the same path and traverses other unvisited nodes.

The algorithm steps are as follows:

1.We must traverse all components of the graph.
2.Make sure to carry a visited array(all elements are initialized to 0) and a stack data structure, where we are going to store the nodes after completing the DFS call.
3.In the DFS call, first, the current node is marked as visited. Then DFS call is made for all its adjacent nodes.
4.After visiting all its adjacent nodes, DFS will backtrack to the previous node and meanwhile, the current node is pushed into the stack.
5.Finally, we will get the stack containing one of the topological sortings of the graph.

Output: 5 4 2 3 1 0

Time Complexity: O(V+E)+O(V), where V = no. of nodes and E = no. of edges. There can be at most V components. So, another O(V) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(2N) + O(N) ~ O(2N): O(2N) for the visited array and the stack carried during DFS calls and O(N) for recursive stack space, where N = no. of nodes.
